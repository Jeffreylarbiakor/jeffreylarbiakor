# Hi, I'm Jeffrey 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

<img src="https://tdwi.org/-/media/TDWI/TDWI/BITW/machinelearning4.jpg">
I'm a Data Scientist who is passionate about the role of Data Science in generating insights from data, creating technology to make life easier, and building a TechED team within my local community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Microsoft Azure CloudOps & DevOps, PowerBI, Tableau, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Wolfram Alpha, ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and PostgreSQL. In 2020, I was officially recognized as a Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate and was selected to be a GIZ Digital Skills Mentor based on my involvement in the Azubi Africa tech community.  My interest in the Data Science and Machine Learning ecosystem led me to launch JayLabs TechED, a community to train Data Analysts and Scientists.
